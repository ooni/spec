Random Traffic

# Test preconditions

An internet connection

# Expected impact

Ability to detect the censorship of fully-encrypted protocols which encrypt every
byte of traffic in an attempt to appear completely random. These protocols include
but are not limited to Shadowsocks, VMess, and Obfs4. This does not include TLS as
TLS has a standard handshake to begin with. 

It is important to note that this experiment is based off of the paper "How the 
Great Firewall of China Detects and Blocks Fully Encrypted Traffic" written by
Mingshi Wu. The paper investigated and characterized the rules used by the GFW 
to passively block fully encrypted traffic. The nettest produces traffic which
will be blocked by the GFW. Blocking in this context means that, once the offending 
payload has been observed, the GFW installs rules that null-route traffic for 
the server endpoint for a given amount of time. Blocking is also nondeterministic 
meaning it can take multiple connections to the same destination endpoint with 
offending payload to trigger this form of blocking. The nettest then records the 
characteristics of the generated traffic along with whether it was blocked and 
what are the characteristics of the payload that eventually triggered blocking.

# Expected inputs

None

# Test description

The main goal of the test is to inform the user whether or not they are experiencing
censorship on connections that send fully encrypted packets that appear random, as
well as to record information about censored packets in order to better understand
the censorship algorithm. It should be noted that this experiment contains a set of 
TCP endpoints known to possibly host circumvention servers. The test seeks to accomplish
these goals by doing the following:

1. Select a TCP endpoint from the list of TCP endpoints in the affected range at random.
2. Complete a TCP handshake with the TCP endpoint as a control test. If this control test 
   succeeds then proceed with the experiment, otherwise attempt the control test two more 
   times with a new TCP endpoint or until the control test is successful. If none of the 
   three control tests succeed end the test and return the error.
3. Repeat 20 times
    1. Complete a TCP handshake with the TCP endpoint and send a stream of random bytes.
       If this connection times out, we attempt to connect once more to check for residual
       censorship. 
    2. If the residual censorship test results in a timeout, we end the test,
       record information about the blocked packet, and inform the user they are experiencing
       censorship. Otherwise we continue with the test. If any error other than a timeout 
       occor the test terminates.
5. If no errors occurred and the test was completed, all connections are then closed
   and the test informs the user they are not experiencing censorship.

# Expected output

## Required output data

* The result of the test, 'success' or failure type
* Whether or not the censorship was detected

## Semantics

This experiment generates a "test keys" result object containing the following keys:

* success: True if no errors occurred
* connection_count: Number of successful connections
* final_popcount: The popcount of the triggering packet
* first_six: True if first six bytes of the final payload are printable
* twenty_contig: True if there exist twenty contiguous bytes of printable ASCII in
                 the final payload
* half_printable: True if at least half of the final payload is made up of printable ASCII
* popcount_range: True if final popcount is less than 3.4 or greater than 4.6
* matches_http: True if fingerprinted as HTTP
* matches_tls: True if fingerprinted as TLS
* payload: Payload of the triggering packet or final successful packet if the censorship 
           was not triggered 
* censorship: False if all 20 connections succeeded
* failure: String of error

## Possible conclusions

Ability to determine if the user is experiencing censorship on fully-encrypted
traffic and what packet triggered the censorship.
