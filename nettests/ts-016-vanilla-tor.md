# Specification version number

2022-05-10

This version of the specification documents the Go implementation of
`vanilla_tor`, written on 2022-05-10. The
[previous](https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/fc05b9a12f4202d824f2bcdb52b4eacfbb914a4e/nettests/ts-016-vanilla-tor.md)
(and slightly incompatible!) version of this specification documents the original and
obsolete Python implementation inside `ooni/probe-legacy`.

* _status_: experimental

# Specification name

`vanilla_tor` (Vanilla Tor)

# Test preconditions

* An internet connection

* The `tor` binary installed on the system

# Expected impact

Ability to determine if Tor in it's default configuration is able to bootstrap
or at what point in bootstrapping it fails.

# Expected inputs

None

# Test description

The test will run the tor executable and collect logs. The bootstrap
will either succeed or eventually time out.

# Expected output

## Parent data format

* none

However, this test tries to produce a data structure as
similar as possible to `ts-030-torsf.md`.

## Semantics

```JSON
{
    "bootstrap_time": 1.1,
    "error": null,
    "failure": null,
    "success": false,
    "timeout": 600,
    "tor_logs": [],
    "tor_progress": 0,
    "tor_progress_tag": "",
    "tor_progress_summary": "",
    "tor_version": "",
    "transport_name": "vanilla"
}
```

where:

- `bootstrap_time` (`float`) is zero if the bootstrap times out and otherwise is
the number of seconds it required to bootstrap;

- `error` (`null | string`) is `null` on success, `timeout-reached` in case of
timeout, and `unknown-error` otherwise (this field only exists for backwards
compatibility with the previous version of the `vanilla_tor` spec);

- `failure` conforms to `df-007-errors`;

- `success` (`bool`) is set to `true` if we bootstrap, to `false` otherwise (this
field only exists for backwards compatibility);

- `timeout` (`float`) is the default timeout for the experiment (in seconds);

- `tor_logs` (`[]string`) is a list of bootstrap-related logs emitted by
the tor daemon during the bootstrap;

- `tor_progress` (`int`) is the progress in the last bootstrap line;

- `tor_progress_tag` (`string`) is the machine readable tag of the last bootstrap line;

- `tor_progress_summary` (`string`) is the human readable description of
the last bootstrap line;

- `tor_version` (`string`) is the version of `tor` we're using;

- `transport_name` (`string`) is always set to `"vanilla"`.

## Incompatibility with ooni/probe-legacy

The `ooni/probe-legacy` implementation used different field names and/or data types as
documented [by the previous version of this spec](
https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/fc05b9a12f4202d824f2bcdb52b4eacfbb914a4e/nettests/ts-016-vanilla-tor.md).
The following table shows which fields changed since the previous implementation:

| legacy name            | legacy type     | new name      | new type        |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `tor_log`              | `string`        | `tor_logs`    | `[]string`      |
| `timeout`              | `integer`       | `timeout`     | `float`         |

The _main_ difference between the new and the old implementation is that the new
implementation collects the logs as an array of lines while the old implementation
collects the logs as a single string.

The `timeout` field changed only in its type and it should be possible to parse it
using a language such as Python or JavaScript without major issues, since it's still
a numeric value. Also, the timeout we set is always an integral number of seconds,
which means that most JSON emitters (including
Golang's JSON emitter) will emit an integer.

## Possible conclusions

If Tor with the default configuration can successfully bootstrap.
