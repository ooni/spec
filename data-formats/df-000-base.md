# Base Data Format

This document describes the toplevel keys of the data format. See this
directory's [README](README.md) for the basic concepts.

```

- `annotations` (`map[string]string`; optional): key-value annotations to the
report that provide metadata to this measurement. See below.

- `backend_version` (`string`; optional): version of the backend that has
collected this specific measurement.  Note that clients of course are not
supposed to emit this field.

- `bucket_date` (`string`): a date like `"2006-01-02"` that indicates
when this measurement was processed by the data pipeline. Note that clients
of course are not supposed to emit this field.

- `data_format_version` (`string`): indicates the data format version. See
[README.md](README.md) for the current version and for the versions history.

- `id` (`string`; optional): client-generated UUID4 identifying this measurement
in the context of a set of measurements (i.e. a report). Consumers of OONI data
SHOULD NOT trust this identifier to uniquely identify the measurement. This
identifier is only meaningful for measurements that have not been submitted to
a OONI collector yet. In fact, OONI collectors SHOULD clear this field to avoid
any potential confusion caused by it.

- `input` (`string`; optional; nullable): if this experiment accepts any input, the
input that was used to produce this measurement. For example, the Web
Connectivity experiment uses URLs as input.

- `input_hashes` (`[]string`; optional; deprecated): historical field that
used to contain the SHA256s of all inputs provided to the experiment. Modern
implementations, e.g. Measurement Kit, typically emit an empty list. All
clients using `v0.3.0` of the data format SHOULD NOT emit this field at all.

- `measurement_start_time` (`string`): time when this measurement was
started in UTC, using the `"2006-01-02 08:04:05"` format. Note that
ooniprobe <= 1.4.0 generates skewed time information.

- `options` (`[]string`; optional; deprecated): list of options passed on the
command line when running this specific experiment. Modern implementations,
e.g. Measurement Kit, typically emit an empty list here. All clients using
`v0.3.0` of the data format SHOULD NOT emit this field at all.

- `probe_asn` (`string`): AS Number of the probe (prefixed by AS, e.g.,
`"AS1234"`), or `"AS0"` if the user does not want to share their ASN.

- `probe_cc` (`string`): two letter country code of the probe (e.g.,
`"IT"`) or `"ZZ"` if the user does not want to share their country code.

- `probe_city` (`string`; optional; deprecated): name of the city where the
measurement was run. If the user does not want to share this information,
this field should be set to `null` by `v0.2.0` clients. Clients using `v0.3.0`
of this specification SHOULD NOT emit this field.

- `probe_ip` (`string`): IP address of the probe, or `"127.0.0.1"` if
the user does not want to share their IP.

- `report_filename` (`string`): name of the file containing the report, i.e.,
a set of related measurements, in our infrastructure. Note that clients of
course are not supposed to emit this field.

- `report_id` (`string`): identifier of a set of related measurements
generated by OONI backends when submitting one or more measurements.

- `resolver_asn` (`string`; since `0.3.1`): like `probe_asn` but for
`resolver_ip` rather than for `probe_ip`.

- `resolver_ip` (`string`; since `0.3.0`): IP of the DNS resolver used by
the probe, as determined by the measurement engine.

- `resolver_network_name` (`string`; since `0.3.1`): like `probe_network_name`
but for `resolver_ip` rather than for `probe_ip`.

- `software_name` (`string`): name of the software that has generated
this specific measurement (e.g., `"ooniprobe"`).

- `software_version` (`string`): version of the software used to generate
this specific measurement (e.g., `"3.0.0"`).

- `test_helpers` (`map[string]any`): map containing information regarding
what test helpers have been used for running this measurement. See
below for more information regarding this field's format.

- `test_keys` (`object`): object containing specific keys that depend
upon the specific network experiment that we're running as well as upon
the specific test helpers that are used.

- `test_name` (`string`): name of the experiment in snake case. For example,
Web Connectivity SHOULD be indicated as `"web_connectivity"`.

- `test_runtime` (`float`): runtime of this specific measurement in seconds
with arbitrary sub-seconds precision. All modern implementations, i.e.
Measurement Kit and `github.com/ooni/probe-engine`, measure this value as
the time elapsed since when we start measuring a specific input (or when
we start an experiment without input) until when the measurement is
complete (i.e. all the fields inside `test_keys` have been computed or there
has been an error or timeout causing the measurement to be aborted and the
error to be recorded inside it). This specifically means that this field does
not include the time spent communicating with OONI backends such as the bouncer
and the collector, but it includes the communication with any backend that
is required to finish off the measurement (e.g. the Web Connectivity
test helper). Note that this field's name is misleading and it should
have been called `measurement_runtime` instead.

- `test_start_time` (`string`; deprecated): like `measurement_start_time` except that it
indicates the moment in which a related set of measurements started rather than
the moment where the current measurement started. For example, for the Web
Connectivity experiment, this is the momement where we start processing a
list of input URLs. Depending on the implementation, and specifically on the
way in which input is passed to the measurement engine, this value may not be
reliable, so consumers are advised to prefer `measurement_start_time`. For
example, as of OONI probe-cli v3.0.0-rc.5, this value is incorrect because we
measure every URL independently.

## Annotations

```JSON
{
  "engine_name": "libmeasurement_kit",
  "engine_version": "0.10.4",
  "engine_version_full": "v0.10.4",
  "network_type": "wifi",
  "platform": "ios"
}
```

Annotations is defined as `map[string]string` but the consumer of this field
SHOULD NOT assume that clients using `data_format_version < 0.3.0` have always
used string values. Since `v0.3.0` clients MUST always use string values. A
client SHOULD always add to the map of annotations:

  - `engine_name` (`string`): the name of the measurement engine

  - `engine_version` (`string`): the version of the measurement engine

  - `engine_version_full` (`string`): the version of the measurement
  engine as generated by `git describe --tags`

  - `network_type` (`string`): one of:

    - `mobile`: when OONI Probe Mobile is using 2G/3G/4G/5G networks.

    - `wifi`: when OONI Probe Mobile is using Wi-Fi networks.

  - `platform` (`string`): one of:

    - `android`

    - `ios`

    - `lepidopter`

    - `linux`

    - `macos`

    - `windows`

## Test Helpers

Historically we have saved into `test_helpers` two different data structures:

```JSON
{"backend": "1.1.1.1:853"}
```

used, e.g., by HTTP Invalid Request Line, and

```JSON
"backend": {
  "address": "https://mia-wcth.ooni.io",
  "type": "https"
}
```

used, e.g., by Web Connectivity.

The former is typically used when there can only be a single type of
backend. The latter when more types are possible.

## Example

In the following example we omitted the content of `test_keys`
because it was not relevant for this discussion.

```JSON
{
  "annotations": {
    "platform": "macos"
  },
  "data_format_version": "0.3.1",
  "measurement_start_time": "2020-01-10 17:25:19",
  "test_runtime": 4.426603178,
  "probe_asn": "AS30722",
  "probe_cc": "IT",
  "probe_ip": "127.0.0.1",
  "report_id": "20200110T172519Z_AS30722_5UdG13d6rEfOVCTHEdMjuXGah8vF6dpShA0jditnrHCmH10o1K",
  "resolver_asn": "AS15169",
  "resolver_ip": "172.217.34.2",
  "resolver_network_name": "Google LLC",
  "software_name": "miniooni",
  "software_version": "0.1.0-dev",
  "test_keys": {},
  "test_name": "telegram",
  "test_start_time": "2020-01-10 17:25:19",
  "test_version": "0.0.4"
}
```
