# HTTP Data Format

This document describes the keys with `test_keys` that all experiments
using HTTP SHOULD populate, possibly using directly the specific template
code. See this directory's [README](README.md) for the basic concepts.

| Name       | `httpt` |
|------------|---------|
| Version    | 0       |

## Specification

```JSON
{
  "agent": "redirect",
  "requests": [],
  "socksproxy": null
}
```

- `agent` (`string`): set to `agent` if the HTTP client code doesn't
follow redirects, set to `redirect` otherwise.

- `request` (`[]Transaction`): list of transaction objects. See below.

- `socksproxy` (`string`; optional; legacy): address of the SOCKS proxy being
used in a nettest. Note that this proxy is different from the one used to contact the backend. Omit or set to `null` if no SOCKS proxy is being used. The format
to be used is `1.2.3.4:54321` for IPv4 and `[::1234]:54321` for IPv6. Modern
probes always set this field to `null`.

## Transaction

```JSON
{
    "network": "tcp",
    "address": "1.1.1.1:443",
    "alpn": "h2",
    "failure": "dns_nxdomain_error",
    "request": {},
    "response": {},
    "response_length": 1234,
    "t0": 0.9,
    "t": 1.0,
    "tags": [],
    "transaction_id": 1
}
```

- `network` (`string`; optional): if available, the network of the
underlying connection we are using: either `"tcp"` or `"udp"`. Until 2022-09-08, we used
`"tcp"` or `"quic"` but we realized that using `"udp"` instead of `"quic"` would
be more consistent, so we also changed `"quic"` to always become `"udp"`. These
changes occurred during the OONI Probe v3.16.0 release cycle in
[ooni/probe-cli#946](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/946).

- `address` (`string`; optional): if available, the endpoint of the
underlying connection we are using (e.g., `"[::1]:443"`).

- `alpn` (`string`; optional): if available and applicable, the ALPN
that was negotiated with the server, typically `"http/1.1"`, `"h2"` or `"h3"`.

- `failure` (`string`; nullable): if there was an error, this field is
a string indicating the error, otherwise it MUST be `null`.

- `request` (`Request`): object describing the request.

- `response` (`Response`): object describing the response.

- `response_length` (`int`; optional; deprecated): this is a legacy field that
contains the response length and is typically set to `null` or directly
omitted by modern clients (e.g. from Measurement Kit onwards).

- `t0` (`float`): number of seconds elapsed since `measurement_start_time`
measured in the moment in which we started the operation (`t - t0` gives you
the amount of time spent performing the operation);

- `t` (`float`): number of seconds elapsed since `measurement_start_time`
measured in the moment in which `failure` is determined (`t - t0` gives you
the amount of time spent performing the operation);

- `tags` (`[]string`; optional): list of tags for this event. This is useful to
understand what part of a complex measurement generated an event.

- `transaction_id` (`int`; optional; since 2020-01-11): the set of operations
to which this event belongs to (typically an HTTP transaction or a DNS
round trip). A zero or missing value means we don't know the transaction
to which this code belongs to.

## Request

```JavaScript
{
    "url": "https://example.com/",
    "body": MaybeBinaryData(),
    "body_is_truncated": false,
    "headers": {},
    "headers_list": [],
    "method": "GET",
    "tor": {},
    "x_transport": "tcp"
}
```

- `url` (`string`): this is the URL that was used for issuing the request.

- `body` (`string` or `BinaryData`): this is the request body. The body is a
`string` if it can be represented using UTF-8. Otherwise it is a `BinaryData`
instance, as described below. See also `MaybeBinaryData` below.

- `body_is_truncated` (`bool`; optional; since 2019-12-02): `true` if the body
has been truncated, `false` or omitted otherwise.

- `headers` (`map[string]MaybeBinaryData`): legacy map containing HTTP headers
where the value is `string` if it can be represented using UTF-8 and a
`BinaryData` instance otherwise. In case multiple headers have the same key,
the map SHOULD only contain the first value.

- `headers_list` (`[]HeaderValue`); since 2019-12-02): this is a better
representation of headers that allows us to represent the case where there
are multiple values for the same header key. See below the definition of
`HeaderValue`, which in the value-is-UTF-8 case boils down to the
`[string, string]` tuple.

- `method` (`string`): the request method.

- `tor` (`TorInfo`): this is an object containing information on the
instance of `tor` that we may be using for measuring.

- `x_transport` (`string`; deprecated): indicates what transports was used for
issuing the request. Typically `"tcp"` or `"udp"`. Until 2022-09-08, we used
`"tcp"` or `"quic"` but we realized that using `"udp"` instead of `"quic"` would
be more consistent, so we also changed `"quic"` to always become `"udp"`. These
changes occurred during the OONI Probe v3.16.0 release cycle in
[ooni/probe-cli#946](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/946).

In case we have the following headers:

```bash
> Foo: bar
> Foo: <binary-data-here>
```

consistently with `MaybeBinaryData`'s definition,
the headers representation would be:

```JSON
{
  "headers": {
    "Foo": "bar"
  },
  "headers_list": [[
    "Foo", "bar",
  ], [
    "Foo", {"format": "base64", "data": "..."}
  ]]
}
```

Note how the `headers` map only gets the first value.

## HeaderValue

```JavaScript
[
  "key",
  MaybeBinaryData() // value
]
```

The first element is the header key. The second element is the header
value. Because the value may in principle be binary, we use
`MaybeBinaryData` (see below).

## Response

```JavaScript
{
    "body": MaybeBinaryData(),
    "body_is_truncated": false,
    "code": 501,
    "headers": {},
    "headers_list": [],
}
```

- `body`: like `Request.body`.

- `body_is_truncated`: like `Request.body_is_truncated`.

- `code` (`int`): response status code.

- `headers`: like `Request.headers`.

- `headers_list`: like `Request.headers_list`.

## MaybeBinaryData

This is either `string`, if the value can be represented using `UTF-8`, or
a `BinaryData` instance otherwise.

## BinaryData

```JSON
{"format": "base64", "data": "AQI="}
```

- `format` (`string`): MUST be `base64`.

- `data` (`string`): the `base64` representation of the value that
we could not represent using `UTF-8`.

## TorInfo

```JSON
{
    "exit_ip": null,
    "exit_name": null,
    "is_tor": false
}
```

- `exit_ip` (`string`; nullable): the IP of the exit node or `null`
if we're not using tor or this information is not available.

- `exit_name` (`string`; nullable): the name of the exit node or `null`
if we're not using tor or this information is not available.

- `is_tor` (`bool`): true if we're using tor, false otherwise.

## Example

In the following example we've omitted all the keys that are
not relevant to the HTTP data format:
